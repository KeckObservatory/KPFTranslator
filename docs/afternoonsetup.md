# Afternoon Setup

The afternoon setup process for the instrument itself is minimal. Calibrations are automated, so unless you have very special requirements for your observation (if so please contact the Staff Astronomer supporting your night in advance), then observers will not need to execute any calibrations.

Prior to starting observing, observers should run: `KPF Control Menu --> Start KPF GUIs` from the background menu (or `kpfStartGUIs` from the command line on any KPF machine). This will start the KPF GUIs and can be run at any time prior to observing. 

# Preparing Observing Blocks (OBs)

Observers should use the afternoon to [prepare Observing Blocks (OBs)](buildingOBs.md) and their star list if they have not done so already.

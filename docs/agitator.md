# Agitator

KPF includes a mechanical oscillator which agitates the fibers to aid in mode scrambling in the fibers. The agitator is located directly beneath the azimuth ring of the Keck I telescope. It is automatically turned on and off during science and calibration observations and needs no user intervention.

# KPF Community Cadence

A system for cadenced queue observations is being developed for KPF. As of the 2025A semester, proposers can select the "KPF-CC" instrument instead of "KPF" in their proposal cover sheet which indicates their interest is joining the community cadence program.

Observers wishing to observe classically with KPF, should still select the "KPF" instrument on their proposal coversheet.  This includes fixed time observations such as those which are scheduled to coincide with transits or other similar phenomenal.

Starting in the 2025B semester, KPF-CC programs will need to complete a [KPF-CC web form](https://www3.keck.hawaii.edu/observers/kpf-cc/rel/index.html) in which they will specify the detailed Observing Blocks and scheduling parameters for their targets.  This information will be used by the KPF-CC scheduling program to generate the observing schedule which will be executed by the KPF-CC queue observers (primarily members of the California Planet Search team). Note that the web form must be filled out at the time of proposal submission, so that scheduling feasibility can be established prior to the semester schedule being determined.

If you have questions or want more detail about the KPF-CC program, please see their [FAQ document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-TfR6lNEtHO3muw_2Sc7l9Klveb3yovMUu28Jeq21t0/edit?usp=sharing).

# Calibration Bench

The cal bench contains several calibration light sources and can inject light in to the simultaneous calibration fiber (one of the components of the pseudo slit) or to inject light to the FIU and thus illuminate the science and sky fibers with the chosen calibration lamp.

Most of the calibration sources are located in the "octagon".  A rotating fold mirror can direct light from one of 8 ports to the calibration fibers. The octagon light sources are:

- `EtalonFiber`: Light from a "SuperK" continuum source which has passed through the Etalon.
- `BrdbandFiber`: A broadband lamp.
- `U_gold`: A UNe arc lamp
- `U_daily`: A UNe arc lamp
- `Th_daily`: A ThAr arc lamp
- `Th_gold`: A ThAr arc lamp
- `SoCal-CalFib`: Light from the [Solar Calibrator](socal.md)
- `LFCFiber`: Light from the Laser Frequency Comb (LFC)
